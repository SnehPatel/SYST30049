SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle

- A detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software
- Defines a method for improving the quality of software and the overall development process

Stages of a typical SDLC
  1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
      - Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC
      - Information is used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas
  2. Defining Requirements
      - Clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts
      - Done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed
  3. Designing the Product Architecture
      - SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed
      - Usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS (Design Document Specification)
  4. Building or Developing the Product
      - Actual development starts and the product is built
      - Programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage
  5. Testing the Product
      - Subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC
      - This stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked fixed and retested until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS
  6. Deployment in the Market and Maintenance
      - Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate Market

SDLC Models
  - Various SDLC defined and designed which are followed during the software development process
  - Models are referred to as "Software Development Process Models"

Examples of SD process
  - Waterfall Model
  - Iterative Model
  - Spiral Model
  - Agile
