- Defines a method for improving the quality of software and the overall development process

Stages of a typical SDLC
  1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
      - Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC
      - Information is used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas
  2. Defining Requirements
      - Clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts
      - Done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed
  3. Designing the Product Architecture
      - SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed
      - Usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS (Design Document Specification)
  4. Building or Developing the Product
  5. Testing the Product
  6. Deployment in the Market and Maintenance
