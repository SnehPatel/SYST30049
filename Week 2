Week 2

Wicked problems
  - Not understood until after the creation of a solution
    - It is defined and solved at the same time
  - Have no stopping rule
    - There is no final, correct solution
  - Solutions to wicked problems are not right or wrong
    - Solutions are either good-enough or not-good-enough
  - Every wicked problem us essentially novel and unique
  - Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions

Tame Problems
  - Have well-defined and stable problem statements
  - Definite stopping points when a solution is reached
  - Solution to a tame problem can be objectively evaluated as right or wrong
  - Belongs to a class of similar problems which are solved in similar ways
  - Solutions which can be easily tried and abandoned
  - Comes with a limited set of alternative solutions

Solving Problems
  Tame
    - Linear problem solving
    - Start with a problem and progressively build a solution
    - Activities are performed in order
  Wicked
    - Opportunistic/opportunity driven problem solving
    - Activities are performed iteratively evolving the artifacts they produce
